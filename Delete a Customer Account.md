<p>
  Apollo can delete a customer account if the following conditions are met:
</p>
<ul class="check--list">
  <li>The account does not have an active paid subscription</li>
  <li>The request is submitted by an account admin</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If the account is subscribed to a paid plan, cancel the subscription first before
  proceeding with deletion. Refer to
  <a href="https://www.notion.so/How-to-Cancel-a-Plan-223c33039df3409eb9e67adcd5ffb1ae?pvs=21">How to Cancel a Plan</a>.
</p>
<p>
  There is no need to fill out the cancellation form 2.0. However, Support must
  still document the reason for cancellation and include the approver (if any)
  in the account's activity log to ensure visibility for the Billing team.
